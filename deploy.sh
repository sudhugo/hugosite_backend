# The following script is to help automate deployment of hugo sites on github pages. 
# If you're just getting started, I recommend reading my full notes here: 
# https://www.romandesign.co/setting-up-a-hugo-static-site-on-github/
# 
# To run it, make sure you have made some site updates to deploy and via terminal in your backend and save the code in your hugo backend repo. 
# Then type the following (no $):
#
# 	$ chmod +x deploy.sh  #### This will make your script executable. You only need to type this once to modify permissions.
#    	$ ./deploy.sh "Your optional commit message"   #### This will actually run the code.

# If a command fails then the deploy stops
set -e
